We're drowning in content. Articles, videos, threads, podcasts - all fighting for attention, none changing how we think.

This is different.

A **seed** is a JSON file that runs inside any LLM. You don't read it. You journey through it. Your choices shape the path.

## Try it now

1. Copy [`thesis.json`](thesis.json)
2. Paste into Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini
3. Type `unpack`

That's it. No app. No install. No signup.

## What's inside

2.5 years of AI conversations. 416K messages. One thesis:

> **AI can only go as fast as humans can understand.**

The singularity isn't coming. Not because AI isn't capable. Because humans will never use AI they don't understand for decisions that matter.

17 themes. Your pace. Your path.

## Why seeds?

| Content | Seeds |
|---------|-------|
| You read it | It runs in you |
| Passive consumption | Active navigation |
| Same for everyone | Adapts to your choices |
| Forgotten tomorrow | Changes how you think |

The JSON is the app. The LLM is the runtime.

*Ship KBs of seeds, not MBs of UI.*

If this shifts how you see AI, consider starring — it helps others find it.
