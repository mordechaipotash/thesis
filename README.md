# thesis

We're drowning in content. Articles, videos, threads, podcasts - all fighting for attention, none changing how we think.

This is different.

A seed is a JSON file that runs inside any LLM. You don't read it. You journey through it. Your choices shape the path.

**Try it:**

1. Copy `thesis.json`
2. Paste into Claude / ChatGPT / Gemini
3. Type `unpack`

That's it. No app. No install. No signup.

---

**What's inside:**

2.5 years of AI conversations. 416K messages. Distilled into one thesis:

*AI can only go as fast as humans can understand.*

17 themes. Your pace. Your path.

**Why seeds?**

Content tells you what to think.
Seeds let you think it yourself.

The JSON is the app. The LLM is the runtime.

Ship KBs of seeds, not MBs of UI.
